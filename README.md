# Unbored

## Introduction

A simple terminal client for [the Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/).
Written in Python and with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

## Warning

Still a bit of a work-in-progress. I do aim to finish tidying this up so
it's easily installable.

## TODO

- [X] Allow for rearranging items in the list.
- [X] Tidy up the small issues with how the filters appear.
- [X] Add support for links when they're associated with an activity.
- [ ] Error checking. LOTS of error checking.
- [X] Better handle the "nothing matches the filter" situation.
