# Unbored

## Introduction

A simple terminal client for [the Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/).
Written in Python and with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), using
[`async-bored-api`](https://github.com/Damego/async-bored-api) as the API
wrapper.

The idea is, if you're feeling bored and need some inspiration for what to
do with your day, fire this up and select one or more activities. Your
selections are saved so, if you wish, you can treat the application almost
like a TODO list; for when you're bored.

## Warning

This is still a bit of a work-in-progress, hence the low version number. The
main things that need addressing are listed below.

## TODO

- [ ] Error checking. LOTS of error checking.
- [ ] Test on Windows.
